# My website dev repo

Hi, this is my development repo for arlincherian.github.io. I am using the template provided bY minimal_mistakes to create my website. Here, I have posted a brief persional bio and I will be updating all my projects, list of scientific publications, and any posts I curate moving forward. 

I hope to update the website with blog posts as I curate them. 

Check out the website [here](https://arlincherian.github.io/about/)!
